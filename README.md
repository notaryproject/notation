# Notation

[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/notatryproject/notation/branch/main/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/notatryproject/notation)

Notation is a project to add signatures as standard items in the registry ecosystem, and to build a set of simple tooling for signing and verifying these signatures. This should be viewed as similar security to checking git commit signatures, although the signatures are generic and can be used for additional purposes. Notation is an implementation of the [Notary V2 specifications][notaryv2-specs].

    tar xvzf notation.tar.gz -C ~/bin notation
    ```
- Run a local instance of the [CNCF Distribution Registry][cncf-distribution], with [ORAS Artifacts][artifact-manifest] support.
  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 5000:5000 ghcr.io/oras-project/registry:v1.0.0-rc
  ```

- Build, Push, Sign, Verify the `net-monitor` software

  ```bash
  export IMAGE=localhost:5000/net-monitor:v1
  docker build -t $IMAGE https://github.com/wabbit-networks/net-monitor.git#main
  docker push $IMAGE
  notation cert generate-test --default --trust "wabbit-networks-dev"
  notation sign --plain-http $IMAGE
  notation list --plain-http $IMAGE
  notation verify --plain-http $IMAGE
  ```

Signatures are persisted as [ORAS Artifacts manifests][artifact-manifest].
